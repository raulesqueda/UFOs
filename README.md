# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 

After working with Dana’s webpage and the dynamic table working well, she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. For this **we help Dana to add more filters to the dynamic table, like date, state, country, and shape of the UFO**.

## Results: 
We add the filters for the dynamic table inside Dana’s website, it looks like:

![UFOs_1](https://github.com/raulesqueda/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filter_1.PNG)

With the new filters, the users now can get specific information about UFOs, they just need to enter information in the multiple filters. For example, **we want to know the appearance of the UFOs in the state of Alaska, US., founding 3 UFOs appearances in this state**:
 
![UFOs_2](https://github.com/raulesqueda/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filter_2.PNG)
  
This tool could help the users to search specific information about the UFOs.

## Summary: 
The construction of the Dana’s website can help people interested in UFOs; the design is simple but friendly for any user. Maybe we can develop some changes in this site, first, in the filter by state, maybe we could change the abbreviation with the complete name of the state, this to ease the searching for the users. Finally, we could display more images of different UFOs on the website.
